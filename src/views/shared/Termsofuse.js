                                    THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
                                    LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ATHLETIVERSE OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS
                                    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME
                                    STATES/JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
                                    LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE
                                    LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY
                                    PORTION OF THE SITE, OR WITH ANY OF THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR SOLE
                                    AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE.</p>
                                <h4 className='mt-lg-4'>Termination/Access Restriction</h4>
                                <p>Athletiverse reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site
                                    and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the
                                    maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State
                                    of Nevada and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in
                                    Nevada in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is
                                    unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these
                                    Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
                                </p>
                                <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
                                    between you and Athletiverse as a result of this agreement or use of the Site.
                                    Athletiverse's performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal
                                    process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Athletiverse's right
                                    to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements
                                    relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by Athletiverse
                                    with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or
                                    unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty
                                    disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
                                    provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
                                    matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
                                    continue in effect.</p>
                                <p>Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement
                                    between the user and Athletiverse with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or
                                    contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written,
                                    between the user and Athletiverse with respect to the Site. A printed version of this
                                    agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
                                    administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent
                                    and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally
                                    generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this
                                    agreement and all related documents be written in English.</p>
